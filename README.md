# nbdev_colab

### Why
- to develop your python package, the test of code block, the package documentation from 1 source of truth: your colab notebooks
- no beefy local computer needed, everything is computed and stored on your Google drive and Colab (with options of GPU|TPU and high RAM)

### How

Step0: clone this template to your github account.

Step1: create a new repo (e.g. name it 'gml4people') using this template. 

Step2: to clone your newly created repo in your Google drive, use colab to open this notebook [git_clone_my_repo_to_gdrive.ipynb](https://github.com/wjlgatech/nbdev_colab/blob/master/git_clone_my_repo_to_gdrive.ipynb) and run it through.

Step3: to learn what to do next, start at notebook `nb/00_core.ipynb` from your Google Drive
